# Introduction

## Background

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic cardiac disease with complex pathophysiology 
involving multiple factors. A major 
hallmark of HF is the progressive degeneration of the myocardium that is 
accompanied by cardiac fibrosis. [@garoffolo2022reduction] [@porter2009cardiac] [@tallquist2017redefining] 
The identification of profibrotic pathways are essential to the development of 
therapeutic strategies to delay or even to prevent the profibrotic remodelling 
of the heart.

Previous studies have found that mechanical stress on the cell cytoskeleton 
can induce the nuclear entry of the YAP/TAZ complex, which subsequently 
activates the proliferative pathways. 
[@elosegui2017force] [@panciera2017mechanobiology] [@brusatin2018biomaterials] 
Although such a 
mechanism may seem to be beneficial for the restoration of the damaged 
cardiomyocytes, this pathway has been shown to be more active in cardiac stromal 
cells, which can subsequently differentiate into myofibroblasts that eventually 
leads to the profibrotic remodelling of the heart. [@garoffolo2022reduction] 
Therefore, directly suppressing the YAP/TAZ complex in cardiac stromal
cells may be an effective strategy. Recently, [Garoffolo et al.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319373) 
investigated the use of a small molecular inhibitor, verteporfin (VTP), to 
suppress the YAP/TAZ complex with or without the presence of TGF-β1, a 
profibrotic cytokine under the maximal strain condition.

## Objectives

We aim to use RNA-seq data to identify the changes in the 
transcriptional profile of cardiac stromal cells after the use of VTP. 
[Figure 1.](#fig1) shows the experimental design of the study. Here, we perform 
differential gene expression analysis comparing the transcriptome of the cells 
treated with VTP with control under the known profibrotic straining condition. 
Additionally, we test the efficacy of the drug (VTP) under the presence of 
TGF-β1, a potent profibrotic cytokine. [@saadat2021pivotal] To investigate 
whether direct inhibition of the YAP/TAZ complex with VTP, we perform threshold 
over-representation analysis to identify enriched pathways in the differentially 
expressed genes, which would allow us to identify whether VTP can effectively
reverse a profibrotic phenotype.

adapted from [Assignment 1](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/blob/main/Dataset%20selection%20and%20initial%20processing/Assignment_1_Data_cleaning_and_identifier_mapping.html) 
and created with BioRender.com.

## Dataset

The data used in the present analysis is retrieved from the GEO database under 
the accession number [GSE203358](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE203358). 
The dataset contains RNA-seq data from 24 samples, which are evenly split into 4 
groups:
- Control (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment (maximal strain condition)
- TGF-β1 treatment (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment with TGF-β1 (maximal strain condition)

## Previous Analysis

Since we have previously performed initial data cleaning and normalization, here 
we provide a brief summary of the previous analysis. The entire process can be 
found [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/blob/main/Dataset%20selection%20and%20initial%20processing/Assignment_1_Data_cleaning_and_identifier_mapping.html).

### Data QC and Filtering

The original dataset is composed of `24` samples and `60583 `genes. After 
removing genes with low counts, the dataset we use in the present analysis is 
composed of `14814` genes. The reference genome used is the human [GRCh38](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index?db=core).

### Identifier Mapping and Normalization

The original dataset contains a mix of HUGO gene symbols and GenBank identifiers. 
We used the [biomaRt](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html) 
package to map the rest of the identifiers to HUGO gene symbols. [@durinck2009mapping] 
The dataset was normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method 
implemented by the [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) 
package. [@robinson2010edger] After applying normalization, the library size for 
each sample has been effectively adjusted such that the distribution of gene 
expressions are comparable across samples.

### Multidimensional Scaling

We evaluated the variance between the samples by accessing the clustering of 
the samples using multidimensional 
scaling (MDS). The MDS plot shown in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/blob/main/Dataset%20selection%20and%20initial%20processing/Assignment_1_Data_cleaning_and_identifier_mapping.html) 
reveals a moderate
clustering of samples based on the treatment conditions, and in particular, the 
control samples under mechanical strain alone are clustered separately with any 
other groups. The other treatment groups show less separation along either the
dimension, but clustering is still observed. Interestingly, although most of the 
samples are clustered based on the treatment conditions and that we did not
observe obvious clustering based on the cell culture replicates, we notice that 
certain samples that do not cluster tightly with the rest in the same treatment 
group seem to be consistent across the conditions. For example, comparing to 
other replicates, in cells from culture `M89` and `M99`,
different conditions seem to have a smaller effect on the gene expression profile.

# Preparations

## Package Dependencies

The current R Notebook assumes that it is being run on the BCB420-2023 base image. 
Additional packages required are noted below. For reproducibility we list all packages
we used in the analysis, including utility packages.

}
# DT package for creating interactive tables
if (! requireNamespace("DT", quietly = TRUE)) {

}

# Load the packages
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")

# We will consistently use package::function() to avoid confusion
# However, the dplyr package has to be loaded first to allow
# definitions of various operators such as %>%
```

## Data Import

In the previous analysis, we have saved the processed data output to a file. 
Hence, we can simply load the data from the file and perform the analysis.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the processed data
counts <- read.csv(file = "./Data/expr_norm_counts.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# View the first few rows of the data
head(counts)
```

**Table 1.** Processed count data used for the present analysis. The data is composed of
`r nrow(counts)` genes and `r ncol(counts)` samples, where each gene is identified by a 
unique HUGO symbol. The first few rows are shown.

Since the header of the data contains the sample information, we will extract the sample
information from the header to reconstruct the experimental design.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the sample information from the header
sample_matrix <- colnames(counts) %>%
    lapply(function(x){unlist(strsplit(x, split = "\\."))}) %>%
    as.data.frame()

# Rename the data frame
colnames(sample_matrix) <- colnames(counts)
rownames(sample_matrix) <- c("culture","treatment")

# Transpose the data frame so that each row represents a unique sample
# and each column represents a unique sample attribute
sample_matrix <- data.frame(t(sample_matrix))

# View the sample information
DT::datatable(sample_matrix[order(sample_matrix$treatment), ], 
              rownames = TRUE, filter = "top",
              options = list(pageLength = 6)) %>%
              # Changing the font size of content
              DT::formatStyle(names(sample_matrix), fontSize = "12px") %>%
              # Changing the font size of row names (sample names)
              DT::formatStyle(0, fontSize = "12px")
```

**Table 2.** Sample information used for the present analysis. A total of 24 samples
are included in the analysis, where each sample is identified by a unique culture ID
and treatment condition. Cells are retrieved from 6 independent cultures, and each
is used for 4 different treatment conditions.

# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Understanding the antifibrotic effect of VTP requires a comprehensive analysis 
of the gene expression profile of the cSt-Cs by identifying the transcriptional 
changes with or without the treatment of VTP. To this end, we will perform two 
separate differential gene expression analysis with and without the presence of 
TGF-β1, in which we can isolate the effect of VTP as the only independent variable.

However, although our data is composed of a total of 4 treatment condition, which 
allows for the comparison between control (strain alone) and TGF-β1, we will not 
perform such analysis. It has been well documented that TGF-β1 is a potent 
profibrotic cytokine that will induce a series of transcriptional activation on 
profibrotic pathways. [@walker2019transcriptomic] The authors of the original 
publication has also verified the profibrotic effect of TGF-β1. [@saadat2021pivotal]
Therefore, based on our objective, we believe that it is more 
valuable to investigate solely on the effect of VTP under maximal strain, both with and 
without the presence of TGF-β1 separately.

## Global Gene Expression Profiling

Before performing differential gene expression analysis, we first want to
observe the global expression change at the gene level. Here, we plot a heatmap
for all the genes in the dataset to visualize the expression change across all
samples under various conditions.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Creating a DGEList object
counts_dge <- edgeR::DGEList(counts = counts, group = sample_matrix$treatment)

# As discussed in the associated journal entry, the data we use are the
# counts, rather than the counts per million (CPM) values. Therefore, we
# will need to convert the count to CPM values for normalization on
# library size before plotting the heatmap.
counts_dge <- edgeR::calcNormFactors(counts_dge)
counts_cpm_all <- edgeR::cpm(counts_dge)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a heatmap matrix for all the genes by scaling the CPM values
# This allows the heatmap colour to be on a consistent and continuous scale
# across all the samples
heatmap_matrix <- counts_cpm_all %>% t() %>% scale() %>% t()
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Checking the range of the heatmap matrix
hmap_range <- range(heatmap_matrix)
```

The range of the heatmap matrix is between ``r hmap_range[1]`` and ``r hmap_range[2]``.
Since the scaled expression value ranges from negative to positive, we will define
a three colour palette for the heatmap, where we will use `blue` to represent
the lowly expressed genes and `red` for highly expressed genes. In the middle of the 
scale is `white`.

Here, heatmap creation and visual representation are implemented using the
`ComplexHeatmap` and `circlize` packages, respectively. [@gu2016complex] [@gu2014circlize]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Set the 3 color palette based on the scaled heatmap matrix
hmap_col <- circlize::colorRamp2(c(hmap_range[1], 0, hmap_range[2]), 
                                 c("blue", "white", "red"))
```

Due to the relatively large number of samples, we will also apply annotations to
the heatmap to better visualize the clustering of the samples. In particular,
we will annotate the heatmap by the treatment condition and culture replicate.
This would better allows us to identify whether any of the variables have a
significant effect on the clustering of the samples.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Sort the sample matrix in the same order as the heatmap matrix
sample_matrix_sorted <- sample_matrix[colnames(heatmap_matrix),]

# Treatment Conditions
treatments <- unique(sample_matrix_sorted$treatment)
# Define 4 colours for the 4 treatment conditions
treatment_col <- hcl.colors(4, palette = "viridis")
names(treatment_col) <- treatments

# Culture Replicates
cultures <- unique(sample_matrix_sorted$culture)
# Define 6 colours for the 6 culture replicates
culture_col <- hcl.colors(6, palette = "set3")
names(culture_col) <- cultures

# Create an annotation dataframe
anno_df <- data.frame(treatment = sample_matrix_sorted$treatment,
                      culture = sample_matrix_sorted$culture)
anno_col <- list(treatment = treatment_col, culture = culture_col)
# Create the heatmap annotation
hmap_anno <- ComplexHeatmap::HeatmapAnnotation(
                    df = anno_df,
                    col = anno_col)
```

To better visualize the heatmap, we cluster the genes into 4 groups using the
k-means clustering algorithm. This allows the genes that have similar expression
profiles to be grouped together. [@sharko2007heat] [@gu2016complex] Additionally, 
since our dataset consists of 4 treatment conditions, it is expected that a 
clustering of 4 groups will reveal some interesting patterns in the expression 
profiles.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
# Generate the heatmap
# Set the seed for reproducibility due to he inherent randomness of the
# k-means clustering algorithm
set.seed(91711)
hmap_all <- ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(heatmap_matrix,
                                    show_row_dend = TRUE,
                                    show_column_dend = TRUE,
                                    show_column_names = TRUE,
                                    show_row_names = FALSE,
                                    col = hmap_col,
                                    top_annotation = hmap_anno,
                                    km = 4)
set.seed(NULL)
# Plot the heatmap
hmap_all
```

**Figure 2.** Heatmap of global gene expression across all samples of different 
treatments. A k-mean clustering of 4 groups was applied to the heatmap for 
clusterization of gene with similar expression profiles. Samples are 
hierarchically clustered by their expression profiles. The top bar annotate the 
samples by treatment conditions and the culture in which the cells were extracted.
<br />

The 4 groups of genes generated by the k-means clustering algorithm show
comparatively distinct expression profiles that define 4 subset (cluster) of
samples. However, each of the 4 groups of samples (as indicated by the 
dendrogram) consists of a mix of samples from different treatment conditions.
Based on the observation, we would not expect a very high number of differentially
expressed gene between the conditions. However, despite the mix of treatment
conditions within each cluster, it is still observable that samples under certain
conditions tend to cluster together. For example, the left most cluster consists
of samples that are treated with VTP. We can also observe a clustering of 
a subset of control cells and those that are treated with TGF-β1 alone. Since
these two conditions are expected to show a profibrotic transcriptional programme,
it is expected that these cells share similar expression patterns. 

In addition, the annotation based on the culture replicate also shows a
moderate clustering of the samples taken from the same cSt-Cs culture. This
means that the culture in which the cells were extract likely contributes to
the variance in the gene expression. The observation here using the heatmap
is consistent with the distribution of the samples from the MDS plot. 
Therefore, we will take this into account when we perform
build the model for differential expression analysis.

## Model Selection

For differential gene expression analysis, we use the `edgeR` package,
which implements a generalized linear model (GLM) to test for differential
expression. [@robinson2010edger] Based on the objective of our analysis,
we will build the model based on the treatment conditions. Additionally,
since we have observed a subset of cultures replicates that tend to show
similar expression pattern based on culture number ([Figure 2.](#fig2)), it is
expected that the culture replicate will also contribute to the variance
in gene expression. Therefore, we choose the model to include both factors,
treatment and culture replicate.

<a name="tab3"></a>

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the factors for the model
treatments <- sample_matrix$treatment
cultures <- sample_matrix$culture

# Create the model
model_treat_cul <- model.matrix(~0 + treatments + cultures)
rownames(model_treat_cul) <- rownames(sample_matrix)

# View the model matrix, ordered by treatment condition
DT::datatable(model_treat_cul[order(gsub("M[0-9]{2}\\.", "", rownames(model_treat_cul))), ], 
              rownames = TRUE,
              options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
              DT::formatStyle(names(model_treat_cul), fontSize = "12px")
```

**Table 3.** Model design for differential expression analysis. The model includes
both treatment and culture replicate as factors for fitting the generalized
linear model.

Furthermore, `edgeR` implements dispersion estimation with the negative binomial model,
which estimates the global variation across the samples in a biological 
group. [@lun2016s] Correct estimation of dispersion not only allows
accurate assessment of the quality of the data, but it is also a 
prerequisite for the differential expression analysis. [@lun2016s] [@robinson2010edger]
Here we estimate and assess the dispersion using the `estimateDisp` function.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Estimate the dispersion
counts_dge <- edgeR::estimateDisp(counts_dge, model_treat_cul)
```

<a name="fig3"></a>
```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Plot the dispersion against the mean
edgeR::plotMeanVar(counts_dge, 
                    show.raw.vars = TRUE, 
                    show.tagwise.vars=TRUE, 
                    NBline=TRUE,
                    show.binned.common.disp.vars = TRUE)
```

**Figure 3.** Mean-variance relationship of all genes across various treatment conditions.
The dispersion is estimated using the negative binomial model. A blue line indicates
a trended line based on the negative binomial model, with pooled and estimated gene-wise
dispersion shown in gray and light blue, respectively. A black line with a slope of 1
represents the expected variance of a Poisson distribution, which assumes that the
variance is equal to the mean.

<br />

[Figure 3.](#fig3) illustrates the mean-variance relationship of the genes in
the dataset across all genes and samples. [@mccarthy2012differential] A trended line 
based on the negative binomial model shows an increasing variance correlating to higher 
mean expression, suggesting the existence of biological variation. The pooled gene-wise 
dispersion is similar to that of the estimated dispersion, and both of which align
relatively closely with the trend line.

## Differential Expression

Based on the model design and the estimated dispersion above, two differential gene
expression analysis are performed separately, comparing the transcriptomic changes
involved after the addition of VTP to the cells under maximal strain with and
without the presence of TGF-β1. Here, we employ the gene-wise Quasi-likelihood
F test with the negative binomial generalized linear model to test for differential
expression. We choose the method because it has been suggested to account for 
gene-specific variations due to biological and technical factors and that it also
reflects the uncertainty in dispersion estimation. [@lun2016s] This is recommended
for bulk RNA-seq dataset with a complex design (i.e., the two-factor model we 
employed in this analysis, as shown in [Table 3](#tab3)). [@lun2016s] [@robinson2010edger]

### Effect of VTP under Maximal Strain

First, we examine the effect of VTP in comparison to control without the presence
of TGF-β1. Based on the model, we establish a contrast comparing the treatment of
VTP alone to the control. This is implemented in the `limma` package. [@ritchie2015limma]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a contrast for VTP vs. control
contrast_vtp <- limma::makeContrasts("treatmentsVTP - treatmentsCTRL", 
                                        levels = model_treat_cul)
```

We then perform the differential expression analysis by fitting the generalized
linear model with the factors we designed and performing the Quasi-likelihood
F test as described above.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit the model
glm_fit_treat_cul <- edgeR::glmQLFit(counts_dge, model_treat_cul)
# Perform the differential expression analysis
qlf_vtp_ctrl <- edgeR::glmQLFTest(glmfit = glm_fit_treat_cul, 
                                  contrast = contrast_vtp)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the results
results_vtp_ctrl <- edgeR::topTags(qlf_vtp_ctrl, sort.by = "PValue", 
                                   n = nrow(counts_dge))$table
# Save the differential expression results
write.csv(results_vtp_ctrl, file = "./Data/dge_vtp_ctrl.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

We will now examine the genes that are differentially expressed.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Differentially expressed genes based on unadjusted p-value
sum(results_vtp_ctrl$PValue < 0.05)
```

<a name=dge_vtp></a>

Among the ``r nrow(counts)`` genes in the dataset,``r sum(results_vtp_ctrl$PValue < 0.05)``
are considered to be differentially expressed based on the unadjusted p-value with a
threshold of 0.05. This is consistent with other RNA-seq studies that have a focus
on heart gene expression. [@ahmed2023kdm8] Additionally, a threshold of 0.05 is
also a common choice, since it is a conservative threshold that does not post
a high risk of false positives and is not too stringent that may mask other
biologically relevant genes.

<a name=dge_vtp_m></a>

Since paring RNA-seq expression data involves multiple hypothesis testing, we
also adjust the p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. This method assumes
that the power to detect differential expression is equally likely among all the 
tests, which is suitable in the case of RNA-seq data, where the assumption is 
that most genes are not differentially expressed. [@korthauer2019practical]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Differentially expressed genes based on adjusted p-value
sum(results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05)
```

Ater adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, a total of 
`r sum(results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05)` genes are considered to be truly
differentially expressed. Since it is known that VTP is a direct
inhibitor of the TAP/TAZ complex, which is involved in multiple
pathways such as cell proliferation and migration, we expect that
a certain amount of genes should be differentially expressed.
[@garoffolo2022reduction] [@panciera2017mechanobiology]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Retrieve the set of differentially expressed genes
deg_vtp_ctrl <- results_vtp_ctrl[results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05, ]
```

#### Up-regulated Genes under VTP Treatment

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Up-regulated genes
vtp_ctrl_up <- deg_vtp_ctrl[deg_vtp_ctrl$logFC > 0, ]
# We add gene symbol as a column so that it is searchable
vtp_ctrl_up$Gene = rownames(vtp_ctrl_up)
vtp_ctrl_up <- vtp_ctrl_up[, c(ncol(vtp_ctrl_up), 1:ncol(vtp_ctrl_up)-1)]

# Sort by fold change and visualize with a table
vtp_ctrl_up <- vtp_ctrl_up[order(vtp_ctrl_up$logFC, decreasing = TRUE), ]
DT::datatable(vtp_ctrl_up, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top",
              options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
              # Changing the font size of content
              DT::formatStyle(colnames(vtp_ctrl_up), fontSize = "12px") %>%
              # Changing the font size of row names (sample names)

#### Analysis and Visualization

Interestingly, we found ``r nrow(vtp_ctrl_up)`` up-regulated genes, which is
more than the number of down-regulated genes, ``r nrow(vtp_ctrl_down)``. The top
upregulated genes are ``r paste(rownames(vtp_ctrl_up[1:5, ]), collapse = ", ")``, 
which are not associated with fibrosis or cell proliferation. Rather, the top
downregulated gene is ``r rownames(vtp_ctrl_down[1, ])``, with a fold change of
``r round(2^(-vtp_ctrl_down[1, "logFC"]), 2)``. This gene encodes [collagen type XI 
alpha 1 chain](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000060718;r=1:102876467-103108872),
which directly involves in the formation of collagen fibrils. [@moore2014resident]
We can see that a total of ``r sum(grepl("COL", rownames(vtp_ctrl_down)))`` collagen
genes are downregualed, with none of them upregulated. This suggests that VTP
reduces the expression of collagen genes, which are the main components of
fibrotic tissues. We also found that `P4HA1` gene is among the most significantly
downregualted genes. The gene enxcodes a key subunit of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase
complex, which is involved in a key step of collagen synthesis. [@nwogu2001inhibition]
Among the upregulated genes, we found multiple `SLC` family genes, which are involved
in membrane transport and are likely to contribute to cellular respirations, which
are known to be reduced in fibrotic tissues. [@pizzagalli2021guide]

Here we visualize the differentially expressed genes using a Volcano plot, which
allows for easy visualization of the genes accoding to their fold change and
significance.

**Figure 4.** Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes comparing VTP treatment
to control without TGF-β1. Differentially expressed genes are coloured based on
direction of change. Genes of interest are labelled.
<br />

[Figure 4.](#fig4) shows that the majority of the genes are not differentially
expressed, with a few genes showing comparatively large fold change and significance.
We can observe that the up and down-regulated genes are distributed evenly, except
a few down-regualted genes showing very high significance. This is likely due to
the fact that VTP is a drug the inhibits the YAP/TAZ complex, the downregulation
of which likely leads to a reduction in multiple cellular processes related to
fibrosis and extracellular matrix formation. [@totaro2018yap]

To better visualize the differentially expressed genes between the two test
condition, a heatmap is plotted to support the visualization of gene expression,
and particularly the clustering of samples.

**Figure 5.** Heatmap of differentially expressed genes comparing VTP treatment to
control without TGF-β1. Samples are annotated based on treatment conditions and 
culture replicates.
<br />

[Figure 5.](#fig5) reveals a clear clustering of samples based on the treatment
conditions, in which all control samples display very similar set of up and down-
regulated genes. This is consistant with the MDS plot we have generated previously.
However interestingly, the dendrogram shows two distinct clusters of samples treated
with VTP, located on the edge of the dendrogram. Comparing to the control samples,
it is clear that the two clusters show consistent changes in up and down regulation
of a defined set of genes, but the degree to which the change is observed is
different. This is likely due to the fact that these are biological variations
between the samples, or, possibly due to the effect of adding chemical compounds
to the culture medium. As observed in the MDS plot from prior analysis and [Figure 2](#fig2),
we observe a higher intra-condition variation once chemical compounds are added,
in both cases of VTP and TGF-β1.

However, despite the clustering of samples, a clear pattern of up and down-regulated
genes can be observed. In conjunction with the manual inspection of the top
differentially expressed genes, VTP treatment alone under the profibrotic environment
of mechanical strains has demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects
by down-regulating collagen and ECM genes.

### Effect of VTP under Maximal Strain with Profibrotic TGF-β1

Additionally, we want to investigate whether VTP can still negates the fibrotic
effect under the potent profibrotic stimulus of TGF-β1. Therefore, we also
establish a contrast comparing the treatment of VTP to control where both
conditions are also subjected to the same TGF-β1 treatment.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a contrast for VTP vs. control with TGF-β1
contrast_vtp_tgf <- limma::makeContrasts("treatmentsTGFb_VTP - treatmentsTGFb", 
                                            levels = model_treat_cul)
# Perform differential expression analysis
results_vtp_tgf <- edgeR::glmQLFTest(glmfit = glm_fit_treat_cul, 
                                     contrast = contrast_vtp_tgf)
```

# Save the differential expression results
write.csv(results_vtp_ctrl, file = "./Data/dge_vtp_tgf.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

<a name="dge_tgf"></a>
Based on unadjusted p-values, there are ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$PValue < 0.05)`` genes
with unadjusted p-values less than `0.05`.
There are ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)`` differentially expressed genes
comparing VTP treatment to control in the presence of TGF-β1. Similar to the
previous analysis, we used an threshold of `0.05` for the false discovery rate
(FDR), as corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method, to determine whether a 
gene is considered differentially expressed. Among these differentially expressed
genes, there are ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$logFC > 0 & results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)``
genes that are up-regulated and ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$logFC < 0 & results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)``
genes that are down-regulated, as shown below.

#### Analysis and Visualization

Since there are only ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)`` differentially expressed
genes based on the corrected FDR threshold, the Volcano plot is will likely
show mostly noise. Therefore, we will only visualize these genes with a heatmap.

**Figure 6.** Heatmap of differentially expressed genes under VTP treatment in the
presence of TGF-β1.
<br />

In this comparison, culture `M04` does not show highly consistent expression profiles
with the rest of the samples. Rather, the expression seems to be more consistent
within the `M04` culture, shown as a single cluster in [Figure 6](#fig6). Among the
differentially expressed genes, we can only see a single collagen gene, `COL11A1`,
which has a fold change of ``r round(2^-(deg_vtp_tgf[rownames(deg_vtp_tgf) == "COL11A1", "logFC"]), 2)``.
Other genes are also observed in the previous analysis, but these few genes do not
seem to confer a group of related biological processes/functions. Therefore, it means
that the VTP treatment may have antifibrotic effects, but the effect is not
very significant when a potent fibrotic stimulus, TGF-β1, is present.

# Threshold Over-representation Analysis

To further investigate the changes in the biological processes due to the use of 
VTP, we will perform a threshold over-representation analysis (t-ORA) on the
differentially expressed genes. Gene lists are defined by a thresholded FDR
< 0.05 and fold change > 2. We chose this threshold since we want to focus on
the major biological pathways that are affected by VTP treatment, rather than
mildly affected pathways. Additionally, this threshold is recommended by earlier
studies and have been shown to have a stronger emphasis on fibrosis-related 
pathways (t-ORA using only FDR < 0.05 was performed and shows a more complex
but less focused enrichment results, details shown [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/wiki/Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-and-Preliminary-ORA)). [@reimand2019pathway]

<a name="fisher"></a>

To perform t-ORA, we employed the web-based [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) tool,
which employed Fisher's Exact test  to determine whether the genes of interest
in a certain pathway/geneset is higher in comparison to the genes that are not
in the geneset. [@huang2009systematic] [@reimand2019pathway] This method allows
use to perform a simple enrichment analysis on the gene lists, which we obtained
by setting a strict threshold inside differentially expressed genes. The results
are also valid for preliminary understanding of the differentially regulated
biological processes due to the addition of VTP. To this end, we use the 
Biological Processes (BP) ontology in GO and the Reactome pathways as the 
annotation data source. [@ashburner2000gene] [@vastrik2007reactome] These two
annotation data both supports the most up-to-date functional annotation of
human genes, and since we are interested in learning about the changes regarding
to fibrosis, the use of these two annotation data sources appropriately and
sufficiently support the identification of major processes and pathways that
are affected by VTP treatment. The [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) knowledgebase
was last updated in December 2022, which incorporates `Version 83` of Reactome and
the latest release of Gene Ontology (GO).

## Effect of VTP under Maximal Strain

### All Differentially Expressed Genes

We first examine the genesets enriched in the differentially expressed genes comparing
VTP treatment to control, in the absense of TGF-β1.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract a gene list with thresholded FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2
write.table(rownames(deg_vtp_ctrl[deg_vtp_ctrl$logFC > 1 | deg_vtp_ctrl$logFC < -1, ]),
            file = "./Data/deg_vtp_ctrl_FDR_FC2.txt", quote = FALSE, 
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

# Extract a gene list with thresholded FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2 for up-regulated genes

            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

# Extract a gene list with thresholded FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2 for down-regulated genes
write.table(rownames(deg_vtp_ctrl[deg_vtp_ctrl$logFC < -1, ]),

            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

We have exported the gene list to a text file and uploaded it to [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/),
where we identified the genes by official gene symbols. A multiple test correction
was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The results are exported and analyzed
in the following section.

We first examine the enrichment result using all differentially expressed genes with 
thresholded FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2. The results are shown in [Table 8](#tab8).

            DT::formatStyle(0, fontSize = "12px")
```

**Table 8.** Enriched genesets in differentially expressed genes comparing VTP treatment

A total of ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl)`` genesets are enriched in this analysis, which
includes ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl[genesets_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05, ])`` genesets determined
to be significant after multiple test correction. The top 5 enriched genesets are
related to extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion processes.

### Up-regulated Genes in VTP

We further perform threshold over-representation analysis on the up-regulated genes
and down-regulated genes under VTP treatment separately, with results shown in 
[Table 9](#tab9) and [Table 10](#tab10), respectively. The same threshold was used
for gene list definition as in the previous section.

**Table 9.** Enriched genesets in up-regulated genes comparing VTP treatment to control.
<br />

In upregulated genes alone, we observed ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl_upreg)`` genesets
enriched, including ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl_upreg[genesets_vtp_ctrl_upreg$FDR < 0.05, ])``
genesets significantly enriched after multiple test correction. As espected, we observed
enriched pathways pertaining to cellular response to exogenous stimulus, which is 
consistant with the fact these are upregulated genes for samples treated with VTP.

**Table 10.** Enriched genesets in down-regulated genes comparing VTP treatment to control.
<br />

In down-regulated genes alone, we observed ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl_downreg)`` genesets
enriched, with ``r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl_downreg[genesets_vtp_ctrl_downreg$FDR < 0.05, ])``
being significant by FDR. Interestingly, using downregulated genes only, we observed 
even more enriched genesets compared to using the whole list of differentially expressed
genes. Since the down-regulated and up-regulated genes are likely to be involved in
very different processes, using the whole list for enrichment analysis likely reduces
the fraction of the set of genes involved in a common pathway. Therefore, using 
Fisher's Exact Test may not be able to detect many other less significant pathways.
This observation is supported by a lower p-value observed in the separately performed ORA.

We will now draw a dotplot to visualize the top 10 genesets enriched in the up and
diown-regualted genes.

# Calculate gene ratio

Comparatively, a higher number of genesets were enriched in the down-regulated genes, with
higher fold change and stronger signficiance level. As expected, the use of VTP as 
an inhibitory drug should result in a stronger down-regulation of genes rather than 
up-regulation. [Figure 7B.](#fig7) shows that the most signifiantly enriched genesets
are involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix. While no previous studies, except
the authors of the dataset, have established the connection between VTP and ECM
remodeling, it has been well established that the formation of cardiac fibrosis with 
elevated level of fibroblasts are associated with an increased level of collagen depostion,
integrin mediated cell adhesion, and the cellular cross-talks via the ECM. [@bowers2022fibroblasts]
Therefore, our result support the proposed mechanism that VTP inhibition of the YAP/TAZ
complex of fribroblast precursors (i.e., cardiac stromoal cells) prevents the initiation of
fibroblast differentiation and ECM remodeling. [@garoffolo2022reduction] Additional genesets
that are downregulated includes insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and updake, which 
may seem to be unrelated in terms of cardiac fibrosis. However, IGF is a potent mitogen
that is involved in the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, and its roles as a downstream
target of YAP/TAZ has been well established in cardiac development since the embryonic stage. [@xin2011regulation]
Therefore, the result of our analysis supports the mechanism that VTP inhibition on YAP/TAZ
complex is a potential strategy to prevent cardiac fibrosis under pathological straining conditions.
The upregulated genesets are likely a response to the exogenous stress posed by the introduction
of VTP into the culture media.

However, based on the few differentially expressed genes in the presence of the potent profibrotic
cytokine TGF-β1, no genesets were found enriched in any of the gene lists, regardless of threhold 
used. This means that VTP treamtent alone may not be sufficient to revoke the profibrotic effects
of TGF-β1. This is likely due to the fact that TGF-β1 acts through Smad-dependent and independent
pathways, where Smad is also an interacting partner of YAP/TAZ. [@aashaq2022tgf] Therefore,
the antifibrotic effect of VTP is dependent on the environment of what types of pro-fibrotic 
signals are present.


# Interpretation and Analysis

## Differential Gene Expression Analysis

- **How many genes were significantly differentially expressed? What thresholds did you use and why?**

    Based on unadjusted p-value, `r sum(results_vtp_ctrl$PValue < 0.05)` genes have unadjusted p-value < 0.05 when
    comparing VTP treatment to control. When TGF-β1 is present, `r sum(results_vtp_tgf$PValue < 0.05)` genes have
    unadjusted p-value < 0.05.

    For details and reasons, see differential gene expression analysis without TGF-β1 [here](#dge_vtp) and with TGF-β1 [here](#dge_tgf).



- **Multiple hypothesis testing - correct your p-values using a multiple hypothesis correction method. Which method did you use? And Why? How many genes passed correction?**

    In the case of comparison between VTP and control without TGF-β1, `r nrow(deg_vtp_ctrl)` are differentially expressed.
    A threshold of BH-adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.05 was used to determine significance. This is a common threshold
    used, which limits an acceptable false discovery rate and is not too stringent that may eliminate too many 
    genes that may have a biological significance. When TGF-β1 is present, `r nrow(deg_vtp_tgf)` genes are differentially
    expressed. The same threshold was used to determine significance.

    For details and reasons, see how multiple tests are corrected [here](#dge_vtp_m) and [here](#dge_tgf).

- **Show the amount of differentially expressed genes using an MA Plot or a Volcano plot. Highlight genes of interest.**

    See [Figure 4](#fig4).

- **Visualize your top hits using a heatmap. Do you conditions cluster together? Explain why or why not.**

    See [Figure 5](#fig5) and [Figure 6](#fig6).

## Threshold Over-representation Analysis

- **Which method did you choose and why?**

    We employed Fisher's Exact Test to determine the significance of the enrichment of genesets in all cases memtioneed
    previously. This is the method used by the DAVID tool and is a can commonly be used for threshold over-representation
    analysis based on hypergeometric distribution.

    For detials and reasons, see [here](#fisher).

- **What annotation data did you use and why? What version of the annotation are you using?**

    We used the GO Biological Process and Reactome as the source annotation data, which are accessed from the DAVID tool.

    For details and reasons, see [here](#fisher).

- **How many genesets were returned with what thresholds?**

    We use a threshold of BH-adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 to extract the list of differentially 
    expressed genes for functional enrichment analysis. Without separating the up-regulated and down-regulated genes,
    we obtained `r nrow(genesets_vtp_ctrl)` genesets.

    For more details, see [Table 8](#tab8).

- **Run the analysis using the up-regulated set of genes, and the down-regulated set of genes separately. How do these results compare to using the whole list (i.e all differentially expressed genes together vs. the up-regulated and down regulated differentially expressed genes separately)?**

    For more details, see [Table 8](#tab8), [Table 9](#tab9), [Table 10](#tab10), and [Figure 7](#fig7).

## Result Interpretation

- **Do the over-representation results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper?**

    Yes. Based on the result of the differential gene expression analysis, we found that VTP treatment
    significantly down-regulates genes involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are
    consistent with the proposed mechanism that VTP inhibits the YAP/TAZ complex of fibroblast precursors (i.e.,
    cardiac stromal cells) to prevent the initiation of fibroblast differentiation and ECM remodeling.

    See discussion [here](#discussion).

- **Can you find evidence, i.e. publications, to support some of the results that you see. How does this evidence support your results.**

    See discussion [here](#discussion).
