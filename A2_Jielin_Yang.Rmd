# Introduction

## Background

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic cardiac disease that has progressively severe 
implications on the patient's quality of life, and it has been a leading cause 
of death and a significant contributor to the global burden of disease. [@heidenreich20222022] 
The pathophysiology of HF is complex and involves multiple factors, but a major 
hallmark of HF is the progressive degeneration of the myocardium that is 
accompanied by cardiac fibrosis. [@garoffolo2022reduction] [@porter2009cardiac] [@tallquist2017redefining] 
During the progression of HF, a process known as cardiac remodelling 
progressively replaces the myocardium with fibrous tissues, which in turn
leads to the gradual stiffening of the heart ventricular wall. Thus, the 
identification of profibrotic pathways are essential to the development of 
therapeutic strategies to delay or even to prevent the profibrotic remodelling 
of the heart.

Previous studies have shown that the straining condition has played a 
significant role in potently altering the Hippo pathways. [@brusatin2018biomaterials] 
It was found that mechanical stress on the cell cytoskeleton induces the nuclear 
entry of the YAP/TAZ complex, which  subsequently activates the proliferative 
pathways. [@elosegui2017force] [@panciera2017mechanobiology] Although such a 
mechanism may seem to be beneficial for the restoration of the damaged 
cardiomyocytes, this pathway has been shown to be more active in cardiac stromal 
cells, which can subsequently differentiate into myofibroblasts that eventually 
leads to the profibrotic remodelling of the heart. [@garoffolo2022reduction] 
Therefore, directly suppressing the YAP/TAZ complex in cardiac stromal
cells may be an effective strategy. Recently, a study by [Garoffolo et al.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319373) 
investigated the use of a small molecular inhibitor, verteporfin (VTP), to 
suppress the YAP/TAZ complex with or without the presence of TGF-β1, a 
profibrotic cytokine under the maximal strain condition.

## Objectives

The study by [Garoffolo et al.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319373) 
aimed to examine the antifibrotic effect of VTP in cardiac stromal cells under 
profibrotic signals that simulates the straining conditions under heart failure 
as part of their larger objective. [@garoffolo2022reduction]

Here, we focus on this particular aspect of the research discussed above. In 
particular, we aim to use RNA-seq data to identify the changes in the 
transcriptional profile of cardiac stromal cells after the use of VTP. 
[Figure 1.](#fig1) shows the experimental design of the study. Here, we perform 
differential gene expression analysis comparing the transcriptome of the cells 
treated with VTP with control under the known profibrotic straining condition. 
Additionally, we test the efficacy of the drug (VTP) under the presence of 
TGF-β1, a potent profibrotic cytokine. [@saadat2021pivotal] To investigate 
whether direct inhibition of the YAP/TAZ complex with VTP, we perform threshold 
over-representation analysis to identify enriched pathways in the differentially 
expressed genes, which would allow us to identify whether VTP can effectively 
reverse a profibrotic phenotype.

and created with BioRender.com.

## Dataset

The data used in the present analysis is retrieved from the GEO database under 
the accession number [GSE203358](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE203358). 
The dataset contains RNA-seq data from 24 samples, which are evenly split into 4 
groups:
- Control (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment (maximal strain condition)
- TGF-β1 treatment (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment with TGF-β1 (maximal strain condition)

## Previous Analysis

Since we have previously performed initial data cleaning and normalization, here 
we provide a brief summary of the previous analysis. The entire process can be 
found [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/blob/main/Dataset%20selection%20and%20initial%20processing/Assignment_1_Data_cleaning_and_identifier_mapping.html).

### Data QC and Filtering

The original dataset is composed of `24` samples and `60583 `genes. After 
removing genes with low counts, the dataset we use in the present analysis is 
composed of `14814` genes. The reference genome used is the human [GRCh38](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index?db=core) genome.

### Identifier Mapping and Normalization

The original dataset contains a mix of HUGO gene symbols and GenBank identifiers. 
We used the [biomaRt](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html) 
package to map the rest of the identifiers to HUGO gene symbols. [@durinck2009mapping] 
The dataset is normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method 
implemented by the [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) 
package. [@robinson2010edger] After applying normalization, the library size for 
each sample has been effectively adjusted such that the distribution of gene 
expressions are comparable across samples.

### Multidimensional Scaling

We evaluated the similarity between the samples by accessing the clustering of 
the samples (as well as replicates within each group) using multidimensional 
scaling (MDS). The MDS plot shown in [Figure 2.](#fig2) reveals a moderate
clustering of samples based on the treatment conditions, and in particular, the 
control samples under mechanical strain alone are clustered separately with any 
other groups. The other treatment groups show less separation along the first 
dimension, but clustering is still observed. Interestingly, although most of the 
samples are clustered based on the treatment conditions and that we did not
observe any clustering based on the cell culture replicates, we notice that 
certain samples that do not cluster tightly with the rest in the same treatment 
group seem to be consistent across the conditions. For example, comparing to 
other replicates, in cells from culture `M89` and `M99`,
different conditions seem to have a smaller effect on the gene expression profile.

samples. All samples are coloured by treatment condition. The first two 
dimensions are shown. Moderate clustering by treatment and low clustering by 
replicate for a small number of cultures is observed. Figure adapted from

# Preparations

## Package Dependencies

The current R Notebook assumes that it is being run on the BCB420-2023 base image. 
Additional packages required are noted below.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

if (! requireNamespace("edgeR", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("edgeR")
}

# limma package for differential expression analysis
if (! requireNamespace("limma", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("limma")
}

# ComplexHeatmap package for creating heatmaps
if (! requireNamespace("ComplexHeatmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
}

# circlize package for circular visualization
if (! requireNamespace("circlize", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("circlize")
}

# ggplot2 package for creating plots
if (! requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}

# KableExtra package for creating tables and formatting
if (! requireNamespace("kableExtra", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("kableExtra")
}

# dplyr package for data manipulation
if (! requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}

# DT package for creating interactive tables
if (! requireNamespace("DT", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("DT")
}

# Load the dplyr package
library("dplyr")

# Load the ggplot2 package
library("ggplot2")

# We will consistently use package::function() to avoid confusion
# However, the dplyr package has to be loaded first to allow
# definitions of various operators such as %>%
```

## Data Import

In the previous analysis, we have saved the processed data output to a file. 
Hence, we can simply load the data from the file and perform the analysis.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the processed data
counts <- read.csv(file = "./Data/expr_norm_counts.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

# View the first few rows of the data
head(counts)
```

**Table 1.** Processed count data used for the present analysis. The data is composed of
14814 genes and 24 samples, where each gene is identified by a unique HUGO symbol.
The first few rows are shown.

Since the header of the data contains the sample information, we will extract the sample
information from the header to reconstruct the experimental design.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the sample information from the header
sample_matrix <- colnames(counts) %>%
  lapply(function(x){unlist(strsplit(x, split = "\\."))}) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# Rename the data frame
colnames(sample_matrix) <- colnames(counts)
rownames(sample_matrix) <- c("culture","treatment")

# Transpose the data frame so that each row represents a unique sample
# and each column represents a unique sample attribute
sample_matrix <- data.frame(t(sample_matrix))

# View the sample information
DT::datatable(sample_matrix[order(sample_matrix$treatment), ], 
              rownames = TRUE, filter = "top",
              options = list(pageLength = 6)) %>%
              # Changing the font size of content
              DT::formatStyle(names(sample_matrix), fontSize = "12px") %>%
              # Changing the font size of row names (sample names)
              DT::formatStyle(0, fontSize = "12px")
```

**Table 2.** Sample information used for the present analysis. A total of 24 samples
are included in the analysis, where each sample is identified by a unique culture ID
and treatment condition. Cells are retrieved from 6 independent cultures, and each
is used for 4 different treatment conditions.

# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Understanding the antifibrotic effect of VTP requires a comprehensive analysis 
of the gene expression profile of the cSt-Cs by identifying the transcriptional 
changes with or without the treatment of VTP. To this end, we will perform two 
separate differential gene expression analysis with or without the presence of 
TGF-β1, in which we can isolate the effect of VTP as the only independent variable.

However, although our data is composed of a total of 4 treatment condition, which 
allows for the comparison between control (strain alone) and TGF-β1, we will not 
perform such analysis. It has been well documented that TGF-β1 is a potent 
profibrotic cytokine that will induce a series of transcriptional activation on 
profibrotic pathways. [@walker2019transcriptomic] The authors of the original 
publication has also verified the profibrotic effect of TGF-β1. [@saadat2021pivotal]
We have also shown that TGF-β1 significantly upregaltes the expression of 
profibrotic genes (see associated [journal entry](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/wiki/Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-and-Preliminary-ORA#differential-gene-expression-analysis-comparing-tgf%CE%B21-and-control) 
for details). Therefore, based on our objective, we believe that it is more 
valuable to investigate the effect of VTP under maximal strain, both with and 
without the presence of TGF-β1 separately.

## Global Gene Expression Profiling

Before we perform the differential gene expression analysis, we first want to
observe the global expression change at the gene level. Here, we plot a heatmap
for all the genes in the dataset to visualize the expression change across all
samples under various conditions.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Creating a DGEList object
counts_dge <- edgeR::DGEList(counts = counts, group = sample_matrix$treatment)

# As discussed in the associated journal entry, the data we use are the
# counts, rather than the counts per million (CPM) values. Therefore, we
# will need to convert the count to CPM values for normalization on
# library size.
counts_dge <- edgeR::calcNormFactors(counts_dge)
counts_cpm_all <- edgeR::cpm(counts_dge)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a heatmap matrix for all the genes by scaling the CPM values
# This allows the heatmap colour to be on a consistent and continuous scale
# across all the samples
heatmap_matrix <- counts_cpm_all %>% t() %>% scale()

# Convert it back to the original format
heatmap_matrix <- t(heatmap_matrix)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Checking the range of the heatmap matrix
hmap_range <- range(heatmap_matrix)
hmap_range
```

The range of the heatmap matrix is between `r hmap_range[1]` and `r hmap_range[2]`.
Since the scaled expression value ranges from negative to positive, we will define
a three colour palette for the heatmap, where we will use `blue` to represent
the downregulated genes and `red` for upregulated genes. In the middle of the 
scale is `white`.

Here, heatmap creation and visual representation are implemented using the
`ComplexHeatmap` and `circlize` packages, respectively. [@gu2016complex] [@gu2014circlize]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Set the 3 color palette based on the scaled heatmap matrix
hmap_col <- circlize::colorRamp2(c(hmap_range[1], 0, hmap_range[2]), 
                                 c("blue", "white", "red"))
```

Due to the relatively large number of samples, we will also apply annotations to
the heatmap to better visualize the clustering of the samples. In particular,
we will annotate the heatmap by the treatment condition and culture replicate.
This would better allows us to identify whether any of the variables have a
significant effect on the clustering of the samples.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Sort the sample matrix in the same order as the heatmap matrix
sample_matrix_sorted <- sample_matrix[colnames(heatmap_matrix),]

# Treatment Conditions
treatments <- unique(sample_matrix_sorted$treatment)

# Define 4 colours for the 4 treatment conditions
treatment_col <- hcl.colors(4, palette = "viridis")
names(treatment_col) <- treatments

# Culture Replicates
cultures <- unique(sample_matrix_sorted$culture)

# Define 6 colours for the 6 culture replicates
culture_col <- hcl.colors(6, palette = "set3")
names(culture_col) <- cultures

# Create an annotation dataframe
anno_df <- data.frame(treatment = sample_matrix_sorted$treatment,
                      culture = sample_matrix_sorted$culture)
anno_col <- list(treatment = treatment_col, culture = culture_col)

# Create the heatmap annotation
hmap_anno <- ComplexHeatmap::HeatmapAnnotation(
                    df = anno_df,
                    col = anno_col)

```

To better visualize the heatmap, we cluster the genes into 4 groups using the
k-means clustering algorithm. This allows the genes that have similar expression
profiles to be grouped together. [@sharko2007heat] [@gu2016complex] Additionally, 
since our dataset consists of 4 treatment conditions, it is expected that a 
clustering of 4 groups will reveal some interesting patterns in the expression 
profiles.

<a name="fig3"></a>

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# Generate the heatmap
# Set the seed for reproducibility due to he inherent randomness of the
# k-means clustering algorithm
set.seed(91711)
hmap_all <- ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(heatmap_matrix,
                                    show_row_dend = TRUE,
                                    show_column_dend = TRUE,
                                    show_column_names = TRUE,
                                    show_row_names = FALSE,
                                    col = hmap_col,
                                    top_annotation = hmap_anno,
                                    km = 4)
set.seed(NULL)

# Plot the heatmap
hmap_all
```

**Figure 3.** Heatmap of global gene expression across all samples of different 
treatments. A k-mean clustering of 4 groups was applied to the heatmap for 
clusterization of gene with similar expression profiles. Samples are 
hierarchically clustered by their expression profiles. The top bar annotate the 
samples by treatment conditions and culture in which the cells were extracted.
<br />

The 4 groups of genes generated by the k-means clustering algorithm show
comparatively distinct expression profiles that define 4 subset (cluster) of
samples. However, each of the 4 groups of samples (as indicated by the 
dendrogram) consists of a mix of samples from different treatment conditions.
Based on the observation, we would not expect a very high number of differentially
expressed gene between the conditions. However, despite the mix of treatment
conditions within each cluster, it is still observable that samples under certain
conditions tend to cluster together. For example, the left most cluster consists
of samples that are treated with VTP. We can also observe a clustering of 
a subset of control cells and those that are treated with TGF-β1 alone. Since
these two conditions are expected to show a profibrotic transcriptional programme,
it is expected that these cells share similar expression patterns. 

In addition, the annotation based on the culture replicate also shows a
moderate clustering of the samples taken from the same cSt-Cs culture. This
means that the culture in which the cells were extract likely contributes to
the variance in the gene expression. The observation here using the heatmap
is consistent with the distribution of the samples from the MDS plot in
[Figure 2](#fig2). Therefore, we will take this into account when we perform
build the model for differential expression analysis.

## Model Selection

For differential gene expression analysis, we use the `edgeR` package,
which implements a generailized linear model (GLM) to test for differential
expression. [@robinson2010edger] Based on the objective of our analysis,
we will build the model based on the treatment conditions. Additionally,
since we have observed a subset of cultures replicates that shows a lower
variance within cells from the same culture ([Figure 2.](#fig2)) and a 
moderate degree of clustering in the heatmap ([Figure 3.](#fig3)), it is
expected that the culture replicate will also contribute to the variance
in gene expression. Therefore, we choose the model to include both factors,
treatment and culture replicate.

<a name="tab3"></a>

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the factors for the model
treatments <- sample_matrix$treatment
cultures <- sample_matrix$culture

# Create the model
model_treat_cul <- model.matrix(~0 + treatments + cultures)
rownames(model_treat_cul) <- rownames(sample_matrix)

# View the model matrix
DT::datatable(model_treat_cul[order(gsub("M[0-9]{2}\\.", "", rownames(model_treat_cul))), ], 
              rownames = TRUE,
              options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
              # Changing the font size of content
              DT::formatStyle(names(model_treat_cul), fontSize = "12px")
```

**Table 3.** Model design for differential expression analysis. The model includes
both treatment and culture replicate as factors for fitting the generalized
linear model.

Furthermore, `edgeR` implements dispersion estimation with the negative binomial model,
which estimates the global variation across the samples in a biological 
group. [@lun2016s] Correct estimation of dispersion not only allows
accurate assessment of the quality of the data, but it is also a 
prerequisite for the differential expression analysis. [@lun2016s] [@robinson2010edger]
Here we estimate and assess the dispersion using the `estimateDisp` function.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Estimate the dispersion
counts_dge <- edgeR::estimateDisp(counts_dge, model_treat_cul)
```

<a name="fig4"></a>

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
# Plot the dispersion against the mean
edgeR::plotMeanVar(counts_dge, 
                    show.raw.vars = TRUE, 
                    show.tagwise.vars=TRUE, 
                    NBline=TRUE,
                    show.binned.common.disp.vars = TRUE)
```

**Figure 4.** Mean-variance relationship of all genes across various treatment conditions.
The dispersion is estimated using the negative binomial model. A blue line indicates
a trended line based on the negative binomial model, with pooled and estimated gene-wise
dispersion shown in gray and light blue, respectively. A black line with a slope of 1
represents the expected variance of a Poisson distribution, which assumes that the
variance is equal to the mean.

<br />

[Figure 4.](#fig4) illustrates the mean-variance relationship of the genes in
the dataset across all genes and samples. [@mccarthy2012differential] A trended line 
based on the negative binomial model shows an increasing variance correlating to higher 
mean expression, suggesting the existence of biological variation. The pooled gene-wise 
dispersion is similar to that of the estimated dispersion, and both of which align
relatively closely with the trend line.

## Differential Expression

Based on the model design and the estimated dispersion above, two differential gene
expression analysis are performed separately, comparing the transcriptomic changes
involved after the addition of VTP to the cells under maximal strain with and
without the presence of TGF-β1. Here, we employ the gene-wise Quasi-likelihood
F test with the negative binomial generalized linear model to test for differential
expression. We choose the method because it has been suggested to account for 
gene-specific variations due to biological and technical factors and that it also
reflects the uncertainty in dispersion estimation. [@lun2016s] This is recommended
for bulk RNA-seq dataset with a complex design (i.e., the two-factor model we 
employed in this analysis, as shown in [Table 3](#tab3)). [@lun2016s] [@robinson2010edger]

### Effect of VTP under Maximal Strain

First, we examine the effect of VTP in comparison to control without the presence
of TGF-β1. Based on the model, we establish a contrast comparing the treatment of
VTP alone to the control. This is implemented in the `limma` package. [@ritchie2015limma]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a contrast for VTP vs. control
contrast_vtp <- limma::makeContrasts("treatmentsVTP - treatmentsCTRL", 
                                        levels = model_treat_cul)
```

We then perform the differential expression analysis by fitting the generalized
linear model with the factors we designed and performing the Quasi-likelihood
F test as described above.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit the model
glm_fit_treat_cul <- edgeR::glmQLFit(counts_dge, model_treat_cul)

# Perform the differential expression analysis
qlf_vtp_ctrl <- edgeR::glmQLFTest(glmfit = glm_fit_treat_cul, 
                                  contrast = contrast_vtp)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the results
results_vtp_ctrl <- edgeR::topTags(qlf_vtp_ctrl, sort.by = "PValue", 
                                   n = nrow(counts_dge))$table

# Save the differential expression results
write.csv(results_vtp_ctrl, file = "./Data/dge_vtp_ctrl.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

We will now examine the genes that are differentially expressed.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Differentially expressed genes based on unadjusted p-value
sum(results_vtp_ctrl$PValue < 0.05)
```

Among the `r nrow(counts)` genes in the dataset, `r sum(results_vtp_ctrl$PValue < 0.05)`
are considered to be differentially expressed based on the unadjusted p-value with a
threshold of 0.05. This is consistent with other RNA-seq studies that have a focus
on heart gene expression. [@ahmed2023kdm8] Additionally, a threshold of 0.05 is
also a common choice, since it is a conservative threshold that does not post
a high risk of false positives and is not too stringent that may mask other
biologically relevant genes.

Since paring RNA-seq expression data involves multiple hypothesis testing, we
also adjust the p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. This method assumes
that the power to detect differential expression is equally likely among all the 
tests, which is suitable in the case of RNA-seq data, where the assumption is 
that most genes are not differentially expressed. [@korthauer2019practical]

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Differentially expressed genes based on adjusted p-value
sum(results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05)
```

Ater adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, a total of 
`r sum(results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05)` genes are considered to be truly
differentially expressed. Since it is known that VTP is a direct
inhibitor of the TAP/TAZ complex, which is involved in multiple
pathways such as cell proliferation and migration, we expect that

#### Differentially Expressed Genes

Interestingly, there we found `r nrow(vtp_ctrl_up)` up-regulated genes, which is
more than the number of down-regulated genes, `r nrow(vtp_ctrl_down)`. The top
upregulated genes are ``r paste(rownames(vtp_ctrl_up[1:5, ]), collapse = ", ")``, 
which are not associated with fibrosis or cell proliferation. Rather, the top
downregulated gene is ``r rownames(vtp_ctrl_down[1, ])``, with a fold change of
`r round(2^(-vtp_ctrl_down[1, "logFC"]), 2)`. This gene encodes [collagen type XI 
alpha 1 chain](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000060718;r=1:102876467-103108872).
which directly involves in the formation of collagen fibrils. [@moore2014resident]
We can see that a total of `r sum(grepl("$COL", rownames(vtp_ctrl_down)))` collagen
genes are downregualed, with none of them upregulated. This suggests that VTP
reduces the expression of collagen genes, which are the main components of
fibrotic tissues. We also found that `P4HA1` gene is among the most significantly
downregualted genes. The gene enxcodes a key subunit of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase
complex, which is involved in a key step of collagen synthesis. [@nwogu2001inhibition]
Among the upregulated genes, we found multiple `SLC` family genes, which are involved
in membrane transport and are likely to contribute to cellular respirations, which
are known to be reduced in fibrotic tissues. [@pizzagalli2021guide]

Here we visualize the differentially expressed genes using a Volcano plot, which
allows for easy visualization of the genes accoding to their fold change and
significance.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Label genes as up/down-regulated
results_vtp_ctrl <- results_vtp_ctrl %>%
    dplyr::mutate(Expression = dplyr::case_when(
                        logFC > 0 & FDR < 0.05 ~ "Up-regulated",
                        logFC < 0 & FDR < 0.05 ~ "Down-regulated",
                        TRUE ~ "Not DE"))

# Extract a sublist of inportant genes to label in the plot
# Subset differentially expressed genes
results_deg <- results_vtp_ctrl[results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05, ]

# 1. Collagen genes
genes_to_label <- results_deg[grepl("COL", rownames(results_deg)), ]
# 2. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit
genes_to_label <- rbind(genes_to_label, 
                        results_deg[grepl("P4HA1", rownames(results_deg)), ])
# 3. Top 3 up and down-regulated genes based on fold change
results_sort_by_FC <- results_deg[order(results_deg$logFC), ]
genes_to_label <- rbind(genes_to_label, 
                results_sort_by_FC[1:3, ], 
                results_sort_by_FC[(nrow(results_sort_by_FC)-2):nrow(results_sort_by_FC), ])

# Remove any duplicated genes in the subset
genes_to_label <- genes_to_label[!duplicated(rownames(genes_to_label)), ]
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# We will plot all genes, with highlighted genes representing the differentially
# expressed genes

    # Add dots to reprent each gene

to control without TGF-β1. Differentially expressed genes are coloured based on
direction of change. Genes of interest are labelled.




To better visualize the differentially expressed genes between the two test
condition, a heatmap is plotted to support the visualization of gene expression,
and particularly the clustering of samples.






### Effect of VTP under Maximal Strain with Profibrotic TGF-β1

Additionally, we want to investigate whether VTP can still negates the fibrotic
effect under the potent profibrotic stimulus of TGF-β1. Therefore, we also
establish a contrast comparing the treatment of VTP to control where both
conditions are also subjected to the same TGF-β1 treatment.

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a contrast for VTP vs. control with TGF-β1
contrast_vtp_tgf <- limma::makeContrasts("treatmentsTGFb_VTP - treatmentsTGFb", 
                                            levels = model_treat_cul)

# Perform differential expression analysis
results_vtp_tgf <- edgeR::glmQLFTest(glmfit = glm_fit_treat_cul, 
                                     contrast = contrast_vtp_tgf)
```

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract the results
results_vtp_tgf <- edgeR::topTags(results_vtp_tgf, sort.by = "PValue", 
                                   n = nrow(counts_dge))$table
# Save the differential expression results
write.csv(results_vtp_ctrl, file = "./Data/dge_vtp_tgf.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

There are ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)`` differentially expressed genes
comparing VTP treatment to control in the presence of TGF-β1. Similar to the
previous analysis, we used an threshold of `0.05` for the false discovery rate
(FDR), as corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method, to determine whether a 
gene is considered differentially expressed. Among these differentially expressed
genes, there are ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$logFC > 0 & results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)``
genes that are up-regulated and ``r sum(results_vtp_tgf$logFC < 0 & results_vtp_tgf$FDR < 0.05)``
genes that are down-regulated, as shown below.

#### Up-regulated Genes under VTP Treatment

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Retrieve the set of differentially expressed genes
dge_vtp_tgf <- results_vtp_tgf[results_vtp_ctrl$FDR < 0.05, ]

# Up-regulated genes
vtp_tgf_up <- dge_vtp_tgf[dge_vtp_tgf$logFC > 0, ]

# We add gene symbol as a column so that it is searchable
vtp_tgf_up$Gene <- rownames(vtp_tgf_up)
vtp_tgf_up <- vtp_tgf_up[, c(ncol(vtp_tgf_up), 1:(ncol(vtp_tgf_up)-1))]

# Sort the genes by fold change and visualize using a table
vtp_tgf_up <- vtp_tgf_up[order(vtp_tgf_up$logFC, decreasing = TRUE),]
DT::datatable(vtp_tgf_up, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top",
              options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
              DT::formatStyle(colnames(vtp_ctrl_up), fontSize = "12px") %>%
              DT::formatStyle(0, fontSize = "12px")
```

#### Down-regulated Genes under VTP Treatment

```{r message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Down-regulated genes
vtp_tgf_down <- dge_vtp_tgf[dge_vtp_tgf$logFC < 0, ]

# We add gene symbol as a column so that it is searchable
vtp_tgf_down$Gene <- rownames(vtp_tgf_down)
vtp_tgf_down <- vtp_tgf_down[, c(ncol(vtp_tgf_down), 1:(ncol(vtp_tgf_down)-1))]

# Sort the genes by fold change and visualize using a table
vtp_tgf_down <- vtp_tgf_down[order(vtp_tgf_down$logFC), ]
DT::datatable(vtp_tgf_down, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top",
              options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
              DT::formatStyle(colnames(vtp_ctrl_down), fontSize = "12px") %>%
              DT::formatStyle(0, fontSize = "12px")

# Interpretation and Analysis

## Differential Gene Expression Analysis

- **How many genes were significantly differentially expressed? What thresholds did you use and why?**





- **Multiple hypothesis testing - correct your p-values using a multiple hypothesis correction method. Which method did you use? And Why? How many genes passed correction?**

- **Show the amount of differentially expressed genes using an MA Plot or a Volcano plot. Highlight genes of interest.**

- **Visualize your top hits using a heatmap. Do you conditions cluster together? Explain why or why not.**


## Threshold Over-representation Analysis

- **Which method did you choose and why?**

- **What annotation data did you use and why? What version of the annotation are you using?**

- **How many genesets were returned with what thresholds?**

- **Run the analysis using the up-regulated set of genes, and the down-regulated set of genes separately. How do these results compare to using the whole list (i.e all differentially expressed genes together vs. the up-regulated and down regulated differentially expressed genes separately)?**


## Result Interpretation

- **Do the over-representation results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper?**

- **Can you find evidence, i.e. publications, to support some of the results that you see. How does this evidence support your results.**
