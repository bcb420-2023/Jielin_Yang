# Introduction

## Background

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic cardiac disease that has progressively severe implications
on the patient's quality of life, and it has been a leading cause of death and a significant
contributor to the global burden of disease. [@heidenreich20222022] The pathophysiology of HF 
is complex and involves multiple factors, but a major hallmark of HF is the progressive
degeneration of the myocardium that is accompanied by cardiac fibrosis. [@garoffolo2022reduction] 
[@porter2009cardiac] [@tallquist2017redefining] During the progression of HF, a process known
as cardiac remodelling progressively replaces the myocardium with fibrous tissues, which in turn
leads to the gradual stiffening of the heart ventricular wall. Thus, the identification of
profibrotic pathways are essential to the development of therapeutic strategies to delay or
even to prevent the profibrotic remodelling of the heart.

Previous studies have shown that the straining condition has played a significant role in
potently altering the Hippo pathways. [@brusatin2018biomaterials] It was found that mechanical
stress on the cell cytoskeleton induces the nuclear entry of the YAP/TAZ complex, which 
subsequently activates the proliferative pathways. [@elosegui2017force] [@panciera2017mechanobiology]
Although such a mechanism may seem to be beneficial for the restoration of the damaged cardiomyocytes,
this pathway has been shown to be more active in cardiac stromal cells, which can subsequently
differentiate into myofibroblasts that eventually leads to the profibrotic remodelling of the heart. 
[@garoffolo2022reduction] Therefore, directly suppressing the YAP/TAZ complex in cardiac stromal
cells may be an effective strategy. Recently, a study by [Garoffolo et al.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319373) 
investigated the use of a small molecular inhibitor, verteporfin (VTP), to suppress the YAP/TAZ complex 
with or without the presence of TGF-β1, a profibrotic cytokine under the maximal strain condition.

## Objectives

The study by [Garoffolo et al.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319373) aimed
to examine the antifibrotic effect of VTP in cardiac stromal cells under profibrotic signals that 
simulates the straining conditions under heart failure as part of their larger objective. [@garoffolo2022reduction]

Here, we focus on this particular aspect of the research discussed above. In particular, we aim to 
use RNA-seq data to identify the changes in the transcriptional profile of cardiac stromal cells
after the use of VTP. [Figure 1.](#fig1) shows the experimental design of the study. Here, we perform 
differential gene expression analysis comparing the transcriptome of the cells treated with VTP
with control under the known profibrotic straining condition. Additionally, we test the efficacy
of the drug (VTP) under the presence of TGF-β1, a potent profibrotic cytokine. [@saadat2021pivotal] To investigate whether
direct inhibition of the YAP/TAZ complex with VTP, we perform threshold over-representation analysis
to identify enriched pathways in the differentially expressed genes, which would allow us to identify
whether VTP can effectively reverse a profibrotic phenotype.

## Dataset

The data used in the present analysis is retrieved from the GEO database under the accession number
[GSE203358](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE203358). The dataset contains
RNA-seq data from 24 samples, which are evenly split into 4 groups:
- Control (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment (maximal strain condition)
- TGF-β1 treatment (maximal strain condition)
- Verteporfin (VTP) treatment with TGF-β1 (maximal strain condition)

## Previous Analysis

Since we have previously performed initial data cleaning and normalization, here we provide a brief
summary of the previous analysis. The entire process can be found [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2023/Jielin_Yang/blob/main/Dataset%20selection%20and%20initial%20processing/Assignment_1_Data_cleaning_and_identifier_mapping.html).

### Data QC and Filtering

The original dataset is composed of `24` samples and `60583 `genes. After removing genes with low counts, the dataset
we use in the present analysis is composed of `14814` genes. The reference genome used is the human [GRCh38](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index?db=core) genome.

### Identifier Mapping and Normalization

The original dataset contains a mix of HUGO gene symbols and GenBank identifiers. We used the [biomaRt](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html) 
package to map the rest of the identifiers to HUGO gene symbols. [@durinck2009mapping] The dataset is normalized using the Trimmed
Mean of M-values (TMM) method implemented by the [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) package. [@robinson2010edger]
After applying normalization, the library size for each sample has been effectively adjusted such
that the distribution of gene expressions are comparable across samples.

### Multidimensional Scaling

We evaluated the similarity between the samples by accessing the clustering of the samples (as well 
as replicates within each group) using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The MDS plot reveals a moderate
clustering of samples based on the treatment conditions, and in particular, the control samples
under mechanical strain alone are clustered separately with any other groups. The other treatment
groups show less separation along the first dimension, but clustering is still observed. Interestingly,
although most of the samples

# Interpretation and Analysis

## Differential Gene Expression Analysis

- **How many genes were significantly differentially expressed? What thresholds did you use and why?**





- **Multiple hypothesis testing - correct your p-values using a multiple hypothesis correction method. Which method did you use? And Why? How many genes passed correction?**

- **Show the amount of differentially expressed genes using an MA Plot or a Volcano plot. Highlight genes of interest.**

- **Visualize your top hits using a heatmap. Do you conditions cluster together? Explain why or why not.**


## Threshold Over-representation Analysis

- **Which method did you choose and why?**

- **What annotation data did you use and why? What version of the annotation are you using?**

- **How many genesets were returned with what thresholds?**

- **Run the analysis using the up-regulated set of genes, and the down-regulated set of genes separately. How do these results compare to using the whole list (i.e all differentially expressed genes together vs. the up-regulated and down regulated differentially expressed genes separately)?**


## Result Interpretation

- **Do the over-representation results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper?**

- **Can you find evidence, i.e. publications, to support some of the results that you see. How does this evidence support your results.**
